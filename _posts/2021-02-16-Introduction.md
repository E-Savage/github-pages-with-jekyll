When I first got into coding I was actually learning HTML in high school, making basic
webpages really inspired me to learn to program. I decided to major in computer science.
I am a second comp sci student who wants to work in the cyber security field or the software 
development field. If Cybersecurity I want to be a Cyber crinimal analyst and possible afterwards
get into cybersecurity software engineering. If I decide to go the software development route, I will 
probably take up full-stack. Ultimately though, I would like to become a professor at a university beforeretiring. This has been a goal of mine since I was young, also Dr. Savage has a nice ring to it.
